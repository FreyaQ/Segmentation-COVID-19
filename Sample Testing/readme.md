The .ipynb notebook in this folder will perform sample tesing (of experiment 1). The sampledata.mat has sample test CT slices (Fig. 4) in the manuscript. The final trained weights of Anam-Net (from experiment 1) are there in the model.pth (checkpoint file). Download the .ipynb file, data files and the model files for replicating the results.
